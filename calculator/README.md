Hi there!

This is the folder which contains all the code for my calculator. The file "calculatorWithoutBedmas.c" is an outdated calculator I programmed which does not have BEDMAS. The file "calculatorWithBedmas.c" is the newer calculator which incorporates BEDMAS. This calculator took a long time to debug and I hope you like it!! ;)

All the other files contain header file definitions and functions which I need in my calculator.

I will add things (and potentially bug fix things) to the calculator on a daily basis when I have time.
